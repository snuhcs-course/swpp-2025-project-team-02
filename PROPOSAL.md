Target Customers
Our target customers are GenZ users who check their daily fortune but often find traditional Saju difficult to use. Complex Chinese characters and vague explanations make it hard for them to connect Saju to their real life. Fortuna helps them design their daily routine more easily with clear, personalized guidance based on Korean Saju principles.

Motivation

> Market 
The Korean fortune-telling (Saju) market is already huge, estimated at 1.4–3 trillion KRW as of 2024. Behind this growth is a clear shift in why people use fortune-telling: younger generations, especially Gen Z, increasingly use Saju not just for curiosity, but as a way to relieve stress, ease uncertainty in their daily lives. This shift is clearly reflected in digital platforms—Jeomsin(점신) has been downloaded more than 15 million times and recorded 1.64 million monthly unique visitors (MUV) in March 2025. The trend is not limited to Korea. Globally, the fortune-telling app market was USD 32.2B in 2023 and is expected to hit USD 238.7B by 2032 (CAGR 25.4%). 
> Problem & Solution

>> Problem: After the team's own market research, we found that Saju, a Korean traditional fortune telling, has great potential amid huge blooming of K-culture, yet hasn't widely adopted because of its difficulty and lack of fun and easy service to use.

(1) Hard to personalize without complex interpretation - Personalized fortune-telling in Saju is inherently difficult.  Current services either provide shallow and vague readings with little depth or overwhelm users by throwing complex principles at them all in the same way.  In theory, combining advanced concepts like Ohang(오행) balance analysis and Sipsin(십신) analysis could yield meaningful insights, but translating these into advice that fits an individual’s daily life remains extremely challenging.

(2) Accessibility - Korean Saju apps are loaded with technical terms and complex Chinese characters, making the content hard to understand. This creates a high entry barrier, especially for younger users who want simple and easy contents.

>> Solution: Fortuna reimagines Saju by combining AI-driven personalization with daily user interaction. 

     Users are going to collect Chakras throughout the day to unlock tomorrows’ fortune telling.

-	Data collection period is assisted with AR technology to make the user journey joyful. And to provide better results, the optimal place, time and the type of Chakra will be calculated in real-time when the user opens our Application. 
-	Result Fortune Tellings are generated every night with AI-augmented contents. Multimodal LLM w. Saju knowledge base will calculate Chakra relationships between User, User’s Data, the Day, and output a guided instruction for the next day so that users can refer and get cheered up. This is done incrementally & adaptively throughout the day, guiding toward the best result, demanding an AI call pipeline.
Not only an image data but the trace of locations, timestamps, and historical usage data will be used as an input for the AI to create better results.

Test & Demo
The demo of Fortuna will focus on showing important features of Fortuna. We will create a
new user account and test the onboarding process, including AR-based photo interactions where users collect Chakras and upload them and unlock the next day fortune. Then, by signing in with a user account that has one month of usage history, we will demonstrate how the system generates personalized Saju content based on accumulated photos and metadata.
